# sudoku_game

# This code is creating a SUDOKU GAME GUI interface using tkinter, it will create multiple screens linked to one another 
# and will entail different difficulty levels and grid sizes. 

# The different screens will entail: 
# - a home screen, 
# - the rules to the game, 
# - the difficulty chooser, 
# - the grid size chooser, 
# - the game itself. 

# The screens have buttons etc. to be able to switch between the different screens. 
# I have a pdf file of the way my screens will (hopefully) look at the end, with a few changes of course. 
# Feel free to look through these.. 

# Still a work in progress though, have patience!
